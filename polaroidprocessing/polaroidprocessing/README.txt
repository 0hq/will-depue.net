"Polaroid" is a mind-bending puzzle game in a sandbox enviornment that allows the player to use a variety of clever tools to complete levels and achieve goals.
Inspired by Matt Stark's work in Unity, I'm looking to make an interesting and exploration based game that tells a story in a lightweight manner. 
Without forcing the story or characters on the player, I aim to convey a narrative through the experience of the puzzle as you go deeper into the game.
In the future, you will be able to take your own photos of whatever you want, however, this is a demo version.
